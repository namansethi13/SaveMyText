# SaveMyText:
Save my text is a web app that allows users to store their text on the web in an encrypted form and access it from anywhere. The password used for saving the text never leaves the browser which makes it very secure.

## How it works

The user can make a site to store their text by entering the name of the site and hitting the go button or simply typing the name on the URL.

## User flow:


* If the site is already taken the user is shown a box to enter the password to decrypt the site.

* If the password is correct the user can access the site and update and delete text or pages.
* If the password is incorrect there is no way of seeing the data other than brute-forcing the password.

##
* If the site is not taken a fresh site is shown where the user can enter data and save it using a password

* The data can be accessed and modified anywhere using the same password
