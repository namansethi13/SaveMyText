# SaveMyText
Save my text is a web app which allows users to store their text on the web in an ecvrypted form and access it from anywhere. The password used for saving the text never leaves the browser which makes it very secure. 

## How it works

First the user can make a site by entering the name of the site and hittng the go button
or simply typing the name on the url.

## User flow

* If the site is already taken the user is shown an box to enter the password to decrypt the site.

* IF the password is correct the user can access the site and update and delete text or pages.
* If the password is incorrect there is no way of seeing the data instead of bruteforcing the password.
##
* If the site is not taken a fresh site is shown where user can enter data and save it using a password
* The data can be accessed and modified anywhere using the same password
